# Project-14---Encryption-Decryption-Tool
A basic encryption/decryption program

With this basic program you can encrypt and decrypt messages.

An advanced version would include a database to store encrypted messages so that then you can randomly open the program and decrypt any message you encrypted, or someone can open and decrypt your messages by accesing that database !

However for that, I'd first need to learn more about creating and using databases :) 

So see you in Project 15 !
